1. Enter the "sharedir" mentioned in the sourceAll.sh: /work2/07752/as_tacc/utklshare/

2. Copy the commented lines to a notepad or bash script. (These lines are bracketed by the <<COMMENT and COMMENT symbols.)

3. Run this script in your build directory, replacing "directory to source" with your source code directory.
